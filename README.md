# Geo-Resistivity-meter 

Hardware and software repository for a geophysical instrument 

Here will be stored all files and data required to build a soil resistivity meter for geophysical survey applications. This is a scientific instrument under development at the Laboratory for the Development of Magnetic Sensors (LDSM) of the National Observatory, based in Rio de Janeiro-Brazil (https://www.gov.br/observatorio/pt-br). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In this code, to run the Geo-Resistivity-Meter software, you will need the following prerequisites:
<br>
Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. The software was developed using Python 3.
<br>
Python Libraries: The following Python libraries are required to run the software:<br>
<ul>
<li>tkinter</li>
<li>PIL (Python Imaging Library)</li>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>pandastable</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>resipy</li>
<li>jupyter notebook</li>
</ul>



### Installing

Here are the steps to set up a development environment and run the Geo-Resistivity-Meter:
<br>
Install Python: If you don't have Python installed yet, download and install the latest Python 3 version from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/).
Download the Source Code: Download the Geo-Resistivity-Meter source code from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/LDSM-ON/Geo-Resistivity-meter.
<br>
Navigate to the Project Directory: Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Geo-Resistivity-Meter source code.
<br>
Run the Program: With all the required libraries and files installed, you can run the program by opening the Python file named "Geo-Resistivity-Meter.py". <br>
The program will start, and the graphical interface of the Geo-Resistivity-Meter will be displayed, allowing you to interact with the different functionalities of the software.
<br>
Now you have the development environment set up and the Geo-Resistivity-Meter running on your computer. You can explore the various geophysical analysis and functionalities offered by the program. Remember that any additional dependencies or specific files required for the correct operation of the software should be downloaded and configured as needed.

## Running the tests

The Geo-Resistivity-Meter system has an automated test file to ensure its proper functionality. To run the automated tests for the system, follow these steps:
<br>
Ensure that all system dependencies are installed correctly, as mentioned in the "Installation" section.
<br>
Navigate to the "examples/dc_2d" folder that contains the "root_file.csv" file.
